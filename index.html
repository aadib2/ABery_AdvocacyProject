    <p class ="text_styling"> Environmental conservation describes efforts by individuals, communities,     corporations, governments, and other
      groups to conserve the natural environment and its resources for sustainable development. It is a critical issue
      that requires immediate attention and action. However, it might not be clear how an everyday person can make a
      difference and how they can contribute to our planet's well-being. This website is all about informing you about
      environmental causes and how YOU can make a difference through various things in your everyday life. </p>

    <h2 id = "sub-header"> Why care about environmental conservation and sustainability? </h2>
      <ul class = "text_styling">
          <li> Helps conserve resources: Earth is precious and it is home to all life that inhabits the world. We must be mindful of the natural resources we use because they are limited and needed for all life to thrive!</li>
          <li> Safeguarding our wildlife and animals: Things like preventing habitat destruction and conserving our forests are crucial in protecting habitats for these animals, especially endangered species.</li>
          <li> Mitigate climate change: Climate change is a serious issue that is impacting our very way of life, affecting sea levels, increasing droughts and the severity of storms, and resulting in the loss of species. By living sustainably, you are making a change one step at a time!</li>
          <li>Boost your mental health and reduce your carbon footprint!</li>

    <h2 id = "sub-header2"> What environmental causes can you support and how are they impacting the environment? </h2>
    <!-- some causes include reforestation, water conservation, waste reduction, ocean cleanup, protection of endangered species, and reduce pollution -->
    <ol>
      <li> <h3 id = "sub-header"> Water Conservation </h3> </li>
        <ul class = "text_styling">
         <li>Water conservation is one of the most important environmental causes. It is the practice of using water efficiently to reduce unneccessary water usage</li>
         <li> It's main goal is to ensure humans have clean water to sustain life now and for future generations. </li>
         <li> However, from an environmental standpoint, so many different ecosystems rely on this water that we divert from estuaries, lakes, rivers, and bays, especially with wetlands. It also saves energy and lessens greenhouse gas emissions that result from filtering, treating, and heating water!</li>
        </ul>
      <li> <h3 id = "sub-header"> Waste Reduction </h3></li>
        <ul class = "text_styling">
          <li> Waste reduction is defined as anything that reduces waste by using less material and resources</li>
          <li> Its main representation is reduce, reuse, recycle which is extremely important for the environment if done correctly</li>
          <li> By reducing the amount of waste we create, we are saving renewable and non-renewable resources and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It also reduces the impact of chemical waste from landfills and waste disposal sites on the environment!</li>
        </ul>
      <li> <h3 id = "sub-header"> Reforestation</li>
        <ul class = "text_styling">
          <li> Deforestation is becoming a huge environmental issue. When these forests are cleared or destroyed, the CO2 they absorb is released back into the atmosphere, there's a higher chance of desertification, increased soil erosion(increased flooding), and extinction of wildlife whose habitats are being destroyed</li>
          <li> Reforestation is the process of planting trees to restore the forest ecosystem. It is a process that can be done by individuals, organizations, and governments and by doing so or donating to an org that does so, we can restore these habitats and ecoystems, absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere and reducing the impact of climate change! </li>
        </ul>
      <li> <h3 id = "sub-header"> Ocean Cleanup </h3></li>
        <ul class = "text_styling">
          <li> Due to careless and improper waste disposal, a lot of waste generated by humans ends up in our oceans due to wind and rainwater carrying them into streams/drains/rivers.</li>
          <li> This waste can significantly injure or kill marine and coastal wildlife and damage habitats which also has an effect on fishing and maritime industries and human health</li>
          <li> Ocean cleanup organizations like the one linked above aim to remove plastic from our oceans and save our marine ecosystems!</li>

          <li> Turn the tap off while brushing your teeth</li>

      <div class="petition-container">

        <div class = "petition-para">
          <p class = "text_styling2"> Our polar icecaps in the Arctic are melting at an alarming rate due to the effects of climate change and it has had detrimental impacts on our environment and ecosystems. It has added to rising sea levels, affected temperatures due to less reflected heat, and caused trouble for polar bears, walruses, arctic foxes, snowy owls, reindeer, and many other species as well as the ones that depend on them. As permafrost thaws, the methane it stores is released, causing more warming. We need your help to take greater action on the Arctic! Earth cannot wait until 2030 to take action. We ask that you sign this petition to call for the United Nations to take stricter climate action and protect our Arctic ecosystems.</p>
